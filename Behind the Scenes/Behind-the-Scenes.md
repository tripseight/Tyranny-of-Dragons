## Black Dragon eggs
### Nixie's Gift
On the Fourth day of Flamerule Echo delivered **Two Black Dragon Eggs** to her mother in Calimport. Echo's mom, **Nixie el Beza**, has devised a plan to have the eggs hatched and raised by chromatic dragons in a positive place that also is a pocket dimension where time moves faster. She hopes to present these dragons as a gift and weapons to fight against the rise of Tiamat.
Nixie enters into a deal with Nymmurh.
The two young black dragons can potentially be Echo's adopted step-brothers.
### The Evil One
The **Final Black Draggon Egg** hatches in the dragon hatchery and the **Black Dragon Wyrmling** begins taking townspeople from Greenest in the night.
### Nymmurh's Deal
Nymmurh an ancient bronze dragon, who agrees to help if Nixie takes his hand in marriage and bears him a son who will become king of Calimshan. They can work out a deal where they rule together or potentially work out a situation where the half dragon child would not come of age until after Echo's death.
## Daggerford
### Caravan Quarter
Catering to those individuals passing through town on the trade business, this area of Daggerford comprised several shops and businesses, guildhalls, as well as a number of boarding houses. As such, it was nearly devoid of activity during the winter months, when caravan travel all but ceased.[43][52]
### Farmers' Quarter
As the name suggested, many farmers and other folks that lived off the land made their home within this part of Daggerford. Animal pens and small livestock paddocks were a common sight throughout its streets.

Found within this ward was the grand River Shining Tavern,[18] Cromach's Smithy,[55] and the Harvest House, the local temple to Chauntea.[52][5]
Notable locations included the grand Lady Luck Tavern,[53] Miller's Dry Goods,[17] and Fairfortune Hall.
### Ethanos - Volite
The Temple of Chauntea in Daggerford has been scrying on Ethanos. They send word for Ethanos to return to Greenest and deal with the **Black Dragon Wyrmling**. This should happen at the first establishment the party enters. It can be an Inn or a Tavern
## Delaria Betrothed
Delaria's parents have struck a deal with **The Red Wizard Velcarum Zimms** a leader in a rebel faction of red wizards that intend to take Thay back from Szass Tam. Delaria's parents hope to once again have close ties with Thay and believe Velcarum can prevail.
Delaria can get some hints about a way out. The Red wizards don't care much about raising Tiamat. Their interests are also to gain enough power to overthrow Szass Tam.
