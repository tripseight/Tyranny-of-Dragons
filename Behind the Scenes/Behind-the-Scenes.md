## Black Dragon eggs
### Nixie's Gift
On the Fourth day of Flamerule Echo delivered **Two Black Dragon Eggs** to her mother in Calimport. Echo's mom, **Nixie el Beza**, has devised a plan to have the eggs hatched and raised by chromatic dragons in a positive place that also is a pocket dimension where time moves faster. She hopes to present these dragons as a gift and weapons to fight against the Rise of Tiamat.
Nixie enters into a deal with Nymmurh.
The two young black dragons can potentially be Echo's adopted step-brothers.
### The Evil One
The **Final Black Dragon Egg** hatches in the dragon hatchery and the **Black Dragon Wyrmling** begins taking townspeople from Greenest in the night.
### Nymmurh's Deal
Nymmurh, an ancient bronze dragon, agrees to help if Nixie takes his hand in marriage and bears him a son who will become king of Calimshan. They can work out a deal where they rule together or potentially work out a situation where the half-dragon child would not come of age until after Echo's death.

## Road to Waterdeep

### Ethanos - Volite
The Temple of Chauntea in Daggerford has been scrying on Ethanos. They send word for Ethanos to return to Greenest and deal with the **Black Dragon Wyrmling**. This should happen at the first establishment the party enters. It can be an Inn or a Tavern and Volite can be in the same common area. If the party goes to see Ethanos off they might catch Volite following them. Erick may have an idea or two about this.
### Doppelganger Takeover
The Twins traveling with Tram are actually two **Doppelganger**. Over the preceding month, the twins used their ability to read the surface thoughts of Tram, Zelia, and to a lesser extent Delaria. The twins decided that they can't pass up the chance to take over the lives of two prominent princess sisters. They plan to replace Zel and Del and keep them alive for as long as possible to learn everything about them so that they can eventually take over their kingdom. They have no intention of continuing the quest to stop the Dragon Cult but will steal as much as they can from the cult before making their way back east. The broad outline for the plan is this;
1. Seduce Tram and get close to him and Zelia
1. Kill and replace Tram
1. Use the Tram persona to lead Zelia into a non-lethal trap
   1. steal Zelia's gear
   1. replace Zelia
1. Use the Zelia persona to lead Delaria into a non-lethal trap
1. Replace both sisters and practice their personas while the two are still alive
   1. become near-perfect replacements of Zelia and Delaria
1. Kill Zel and Del
1. Become queens

During the night in a Daggerford Inn, the twins will attack Tram and assume his identity. Both will attack Tram at the same time when pretending to talk about Tram and Arietta getting married. Roll 1d20 and on 1-4 Tram nearly kills one of the doppelgangers and they say that Arietta was attacked by her sister (Zelia may discover Tram dead and out the Doppelgangers at this point), 5-16 the doppelganger wait to attack on the road, 17-20 the sisters quickly kill Tram and try to make a move on Zelia the same night.

Tram put up a good fight and the Doppelgangers decide to wait to attack Zelia on the road. Tram(Zelina) shows up late in the morning without Arietta and explains that she decided to stay behind to try and smooth things over with her sister. Tram acts upset about Arietta staying behind but says that he believes that Arietta will join back up with him in a couple of weeks when he passes back through Daggerford.
>I'm sorry that I'm late, Arietta has decided to stay behind to try and patch things up between her and Zelina. I wanted her to come now but she said that she would come with me when I pass through on my way back to Baldur's Gate. I'm just worried that she'll want to stay here with her sister when I come back in a couple of weeks.

The doppelganger's true plan is for Arietta to travel ahead as fast as she can (she can make it there in just under a day) and set up a trap for Zelia in the forest at the hostelry two days out from Daggerford. Arietta gains two levels of exhaustion pulling off this feat. In the night Tram will try to separate Zelia from the caravan and trap her in the [pit trap](#pit-trap) that Arietta made.
>(whispering)Zelia wake up! I just saw that gnome chick steal something from one of the carts and run off into the forest. Grab your gear, if we hurry we can catch her.
If Zelia tries to get the rest of the party Tram objects and says;
>Come on Zel, we can handle one gnome. Besides, we're almost at the end of the trip and you and I haven't had a single adventure for just the two of us. We may never see each other again and I might lose all the friends I made on this trip. Please, let's do this with just the two of us.

If the twins succeed at trapping Zelia and taking her gear, Tram(Zelina) and Zelia(Arietta played by Suzzana) will attempt to kidnap and replace Delaria. Delaria and Arietta do a deception contest, if Delaria succeeds she realizes that this is not her sister and that can play out however it plays out. On a fail go through the whole [pit trap](#pit-trap) again with Delaria.

#### Pit Trap
Tram leads Zelia through the forest at a fast pace tracking obvious footprints left by a gnome. After 10 minutes (half a mile) they arrive at the pit.

This pit has a cover constructed from material identical to the floor around it, a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discerns that the gnome tracks stop abruptly (exactly at the edge of the trap) and Zelia can inspect for the trap. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check is necessary to confirm that the trapped section of the floor is the cover of a pit. A failed save allows Tram to lead Zelia right into the trap. When a creature steps on the cover, it swings open like a trapdoor, causing the intruder to spill into the pit below. The pit is 15 feet deep and the victim takes 2d6 damage. The trap door that covers the pit is spring-loaded. After a creature falls into the pit, the cover snaps shut to trap its victim inside.

Once in the trap, a successful DC 20 Strength check is necessary to pry the cover open. The cover can also be smashed open. A character in the pit can also attempt to disable the spring mechanism from the inside with a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, provided that the mechanism can be reached and the character can see. In some cases, a mechanism (usually hidden behind a secret door nearby) opens the pit.

## Delaria Betrothed
Delaria's parents have struck a deal with **The Red Wizard Velcarum Zimms** a leader in a rebel faction of red wizards that intends to take Thay back from Szass Tam. Delaria's parents hope to once again have close ties with Thay and believe Velcarum can prevail.
Delaria can get some hints about a way out. The Red wizards don't care much about raising Tiamat. Their interests are also to gain enough power to overthrow Szass Tam.
