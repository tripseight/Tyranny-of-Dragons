## Black Dragon eggs
### Mother's Gift
On the Fourth day of Flamerule Echo delivered **Two Black Dragon Eggs** to her mother in Calimport. Echo's mom has devised a plan to have the eggs hatched and raised by chromatic dragons in a positive place that also is a pocket dimension where time moves faster. She hopes to present these dragons as a gift and weapons to fight against the rise of Tiamat.
