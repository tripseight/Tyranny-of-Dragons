## Black Dragon eggs
### Nixie's Gift
On the Fourth day of Flamerule Echo delivered **Two Black Dragon Eggs** to her mother in Calimport. Echo's mom, **Nixie el Beza**, has devised a plan to have the eggs hatched and raised by chromatic dragons in a positive place that also is a pocket dimension where time moves faster. She hopes to present these dragons as a gift and weapons to fight against the rise of Tiamat.
Nixie enters into a deal with Nymmurh.
The two young black dragons can potentially be Echo's adopted step-brothers.
### The Evil One
There is the problem of the third egg. Does Rezmir scry on the eggs and discover that they are being rushed to adulthood? Will Rezmir try to do the same with the 3rd dragon?
### Nymmurh's Deal
Nymmurh an ancient bronze dragon, who agrees to help if Nixie takes his hand in marriage and bears him a son who will become king of Calimshan. They can work out a deal where they rule together or potentially work out a situation where the half dragon child would not come of age until after Echo's death.
## Delaria Betrothed
Delaria's parents have struck a deal with **The Red Wizard Velcarum Zimms** a leader in a rebel faction of red wizards that intend to take Thay back from Szass Tam. Delaria's parents hope to once again have close ties with Thay and believe Velcarum can prevail.
Delaria can get some hints about a way out. The Red wizards don't care much about raising Tiamat. Their interests are also to gain enough power to overthrow Szass Tam.
